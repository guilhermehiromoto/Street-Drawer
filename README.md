## Abstract

This project aims to detect road shapes in urban areas through the segmentation of roads in satellite images using the [Road and Building Detection Dataset](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~vmnih/data/) and CNN's to train a model that generates maps with the road shapes.

## Partial Report

**Main Objective:** As specified in abstract, this project aims to detect road shapes in urban areas through the segmentation of roads in satellite images using the [Road and Building Detection Dataset](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~vmnih/data/) and CNN's to train a model that generates maps with the road shapes.

**Input images:** Our input images (preprocessed) are specified in [this notebook](https://github.com/guilhermehiromoto/Street-Drawer/blob/master/preprocessing.ipynb)

**Description of steps:** For this project we are using a model-based methodology for Image Segmentation. We used the Intersection-Over-Union metric to train our model, that metric consists of calculating an area of overlap between a predicted segmentation and the mask divided by the union area between a predicted segmentation and a mask.<br/>

U-net architeture used for the [model](https://github.com/guilhermehiromoto/Street-Drawer/blob/master/training_model.ipynb) (early stages of development, just to generate an output):<br/>

**Initial code with first results:** [Preprocessing Data](https://github.com/guilhermehiromoto/Street-Drawer/blob/master/preprocessing.ipynb) and [Model Definition](https://github.com/guilhermehiromoto/Street-Drawer/blob/master/training_model.ipynb)

Initial Prediction:

Obs: Due to the extremely small dataset (only 36 images to elaborate the outline of the project) and an non-optimized architecture, the outputs generated by the model had a result much worse than expected.
